    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put your water on to boil in the pot for the spaghetti 
            (remember it will boil faster if you put a lid on). 
            You can also use <strong>leftover spaghetti</strong> for this, just heat it up with a 
            tablespoon of water in the microwave for up to 2.5 minutes before adding 
            to the pan later so it loosens up a bit.</li>
        <li>Chop up your onions, seed and chop the tomatoes, and grate the cheese.</li>  
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan <strong>(make sure it’s non-stick)</strong> on high heat.</li>
        <li>Add in the onions and stir. Leave the onions to fry for about <strong>five-eight minutes</strong> until quite brown</li>
        <li>Add the spaghetti to the pot when the water comes to a boil. 
            When it comes back to the boil, set a timer for <strong>10-11 minutes</strong> and leave to cook, 
            stirring the odd time to separate the strands).</li>
        <li>Keep stirring the onions regularly and when they’re nice and brown 
            you can add the tomatoes and the teaspoon of salt and turn the heat down to medium-high.</li>
        <li>Stir the onion and tomato mixture well and leave to cook for about <strong>five minutes</strong>,
            stirring the odd time, or until the tomatoes have broken down</li>
        <li>Drain your spaghetti well when cooked al-dente, and add to the pan with the tomatoes and onions
            Toss the spaghetti to make sure it’s well coated with the olive oil tomatoes and onions.
        </li>
        <li>Turn the heat up to high and sprinkle a third of the grated cheese on top of the spaghetti</li>
        <li>Toss quickly with the pasta before it starts to melt, and then let sit for <strong>two minutes</strong>.</li>
        <li>After two minutes, add another third of the cheese, 
            toss again (make sure to lift any crispy bits away from the bottom or they will burn), 
            and let sit <strong>two minutes more</strong>. Repeat with the final third of the cheese, 
            letting it sit <strong>two minutes</strong> again.</li>
    </ol>

        <p><strong>Your fried spaghetti is now ready!</strong></p>
